# Contributing Translations

How to translate the Accessible Arena mod into your language.

## Quick Start

1. Open `lang/en.json` (English reference) and the target `lang/{code}.json`
2. Translate the values (right side of the colon). Never change the keys (left side).
3. Keep all `{0}`, `{1}` placeholders in your translation - they get replaced with dynamic values at runtime
4. Submit a pull request

## File Format

Each locale file is flat JSON with key-value pairs:

```json
{
  "KeyName": "Translated text",
  "Greeting_Format": "Hello {0}, you have {1} items"
}
```

Rules:
- Keys (left side) must stay exactly as-is in English
- Values (right side) are what you translate
- Placeholders like `{0}`, `{1}` must appear in your translation (order can change to fit your grammar)
- Use `\"` for quotes inside strings, `\n` for line breaks

## Supported Languages

| Code  | Language             |
|-------|----------------------|
| en    | English (reference)  |
| de    | German               |
| fr    | French               |
| es    | Spanish              |
| it    | Italian              |
| pt-BR | Portuguese (Brazil)  |
| ja    | Japanese             |
| ko    | Korean               |
| ru    | Russian              |
| pl    | Polish               |
| zh-CN | Chinese (Simplified) |
| zh-TW | Chinese (Traditional)|

## Pluralization

Some strings come in sets with suffixes. The mod picks the right form based on the count.

**Standard languages** (en, de, fr, es, it, pt-BR):
- `_One` - used when count is exactly 1
- `_Format` - used for all other counts (0, 2, 3, ...)

**Slavic languages** (ru, pl):
- `_One` - count is 1
- `_Few` - count ends in 2-4 but not 12-14 (e.g., 2, 3, 4, 22, 23, 24)
- `_Format` - everything else (0, 5-20, 25-30, ...)

**East Asian languages** (ja, ko, zh-CN, zh-TW):
- Only `_Format` is used (no singular/plural distinction)
- You can include `_One` for completeness, but it won't be used

Example set:
```json
"ZoneWithCount_One": "{0}, 1 card",
"ZoneWithCount_Few": "{0}, {1} karty",
"ZoneWithCount_Format": "{0}, {1} cards"
```

If a `_Few` key is missing for Russian/Polish, the mod falls back to `_Format`.

## Translation Tips

- **Be concise.** These strings are read aloud by a screen reader. Short and clear is better than long and formal.
- **Use your language's MTG terminology.** For terms like "Library", "Graveyard", "Exile" - use whatever the official Magic: The Gathering translations use in your language.
- **Keep key names from help items.** Keyboard keys like "F1", "Tab", "Enter", "Backspace", "Space", "Escape" should stay as-is (they are the key labels on the keyboard). Translate the descriptions around them.
- **Test with a screen reader.** If possible, run the mod with your language selected and listen to how the translations sound when spoken aloud. Some phrasing that reads well on screen sounds awkward when spoken.
- **Placeholders can be reordered.** If your language puts the count before the noun, that's fine: `"{1} cartes dans {0}"` works just as well as `"{0}, {1} cards"`.

## NumberWords

The `NumberWords` key maps spelled-out number words to digits. The mod uses this when the game's prompt text spells out a number as a word instead of a digit (e.g. German "Wirf **zwei** Karten ab" instead of "Discard **2** cards"). The mod first tries to find a digit with a regex; NumberWords is the fallback.

Format: comma-separated `word=number` pairs, all lowercase:

```json
"NumberWords": "one=1,two=2,three=3,four=4,five=5,six=6,seven=7,eight=8,nine=9,ten=10"
```

Tips:
- Include all grammatical forms your language uses in game prompts (e.g. German needs "eine=1,einer=1,einem=1,einen=1,ein=1,zwei=2,...")
- Numbers 1-10 are usually enough - higher counts are rare in game prompts
- Languages that always use digits in game prompts (Japanese, Korean, Chinese) can leave this empty: `"NumberWords": ""`
- Matching is case-insensitive and whole-word only, so "ein" won't match inside "einen" (both should be listed separately)

## How to Test

1. Build the mod: `dotnet build src/AccessibleArena.csproj`
2. Copy the DLL to the game's Mods folder
3. Launch the game, press F2 to open settings, change language
4. Navigate through screens and listen to announcements

If you can't build the mod, you can still submit translations - the maintainers will build and test.

## Checking for Missing Keys

To find keys that exist in `en.json` but are missing from your language file, you can compare the key lists. Every key in `en.json` should have a corresponding entry in your language file. Missing keys will automatically fall back to English, so partial translations are fine - but complete translations are better.
